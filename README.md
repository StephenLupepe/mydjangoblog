# mydjangoblog

This is a blog site that I made using django by following a tutorial from Youtuber Corey Schafer (series link: 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p). This tutorial explains how to create
a blog app using Django including how to create the basic views, allow users to create accounts using their email
addresses, and make, view, edit and delete posts. 

These videos taught me about many different aspects of Django including sectioning projects into different apps, using 
models, templates, views to deliver webpages, using the admin page, and handling databases.

In addition to these functions, I also added the ability to like posts, tags posts, add images, and search for posts by name 
or by using tags. 

Adding these additional features, taught me more about databases and many to many relationships, and gave me more experience
in building out website views.

In the future, I would like to add additional functionality to the site, including groups and group posts which will be hidden 
from average users. Also I would like to remake this project again in order to gain more experience making projects in Django.
